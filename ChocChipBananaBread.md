##Ingredients
	3 ripe bananas, mashed
	3/4 cup sugar
	1/4 c. melted butter
	1 1/2 c. flour
	1 tsp. baking soda
	1/2 tsp. salt
	1/2 c. chopped nuts
	1/2 to 3/4 c. semi-sweet chocolate morsels

##Directions
Mash bananas; add sugar and butter.  Sift flour, baking soda and salt; add to first mixture.  Add nuts and chocolate chips.  Pour into greased glass loaf pan.  Bake at 350 for about 50 minutes.
